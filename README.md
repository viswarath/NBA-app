# NBA Stats App

## Overview

The **NBA Stats App** is a web application that provides detailed statistics for NBA players, teams, and games from the 2023 season. The app allows users to view data in a table format, as well as add and delete data entries for players, teams, and games.

The app is built using a **FastAPI** backend with a **PostgreSQL** database, and a **React** frontend with **TypeScript** and **Material-UI (MUI)** for styling. It is designed to run locally only, as specified in the project requirements.

  - **PostgreSQL** (database)
  - **SQL** (pure SQL for data management)
  - **Uvicorn** (ASGI server)

- **Frontend**:

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Set up the Backend (FastAPI with PostgreSQL)

#### Step 1: Clone the repository

Clone the project from GitHub:

#### Step 2: Install proper things

##### Frontend:
- Install Yarn and node (nvm)
- run `yarn add` in the `\nba_stats`

##### Backend:
- Activate python virual environment:
```
python3 -m venv venv 
source venv/bin/activate 
```
- Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` fastapi and uvicorn

---

## Run Instructions: 

### Backend: 
To start the backend server, run the following command:
```
cd backend/
uvicorn app.main:app --reload --workers 1 --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
```
The backend will now be accessible at `http://localhost:8000`


### Frontend:
To start the frontend development server, run:

```
cd nba-stats/
yarn start
```
Open your browser (GOOGLE CHROME) and navigate to `http://localhost:3000` to access the frontend

## Developer Notes:
To restart the server and create every table again with orginal data from csv: 
Add: 
```
@app.post('/restart')
async def initdb():
    try:
        drop_tables()
        create_tables()
        insert_team_data_from_csv()
        insert_game_data_from_csv()
        insert_player_data_from_csv()
        insert_award_data()
        return {"message": "Tables ; and created!"}
    except Exception as e:
        raise HTTPException(
            status_code=status.HTTP_400_BAD_REQUEST,
            detail=f"Error {e}"
        )
```
to `main.py` on the backend. Curl to this `http://0.0.0.0:8000/restart` to restart database!
